title: React in a nutshell Part 1
---

React is an awesome front-end framework maintained by the community and Facebook. Its one of the most popular UI libraries because of its speed due to the way its manipulating the DOM.

One thing that might seem strange to React beginners is JSX. Its a way to add markup in JavaScript. It might feel alien because it seems like it violates separation of concerns, but it has many cool features. 

the server-side rendering that gives you the power to write Universal applications.

If you're just getting into react, you have to have a good grasp of these:

1. The difference between imperative and declarative programming
2. How do React components and their instances work
3. How React uses elements to control the flow of the UI
4. React's new take on separation of concerns
5. Common pitfalls to avoid getting into the React ecosystem


# Declarative VS Imperative paradigms

React seems to be doing a good job at encouraging declarative style of programming. To work well with React, you gotta understand what does `Declarative` mean.


Imperative programming involves giving exact instructions to how to get something done. 

Imagine you walk into a coffee shop and you ask instruct the barista:

1. Approach the coffee machine
2. Take a cup
3. Pour some coffee in the cup
4. Pass the cup to me

While in the declarative sense, you would say, "Hey, can I have a coffee?" assuming that the barista knows how to serve coffee. 

In JavaScript, an imperative piece of code would look like this:

```
toLowerCase(['FOO', 'BAR'])

const toLowerCase = input =>{
  const output = []
  for (let i=0; i < input.length; i++){
    output.push(input[i].toLowerCase())
  }
  return output
}
```
While a declarative solution would look like this:

```
toLowerCase(['FOO', 'BAR']);

const toLowerCase = input => input.map(value.toLowerCase()) 
```

Things to note:
- The imperative example takes longer to read and it pays off when working on large codebases
- There is no need to use variables and mutating state

In the web-dev world, a good example might be creating a map element on a page:

Imperative:
```
const map = new google.maps.Map(document.getElementById('map), {
  zoom: 4,
  center: myLatLng,
})

const marker = new googlemaps.Marker({
  position: myLatLng,
  title: 'My Map',
})

marker.setMap(map)
```

Declarative (React):
```
<Gmaps zoom={4} center={myLatLng}>
  <Marker position={myLatLng Hello world!}>
</Gmaps>
``
The declarative approach makes more sense here because its simple, which ofgen leads to less bugs and more maintainablity.
